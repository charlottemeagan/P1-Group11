# Project 1 Group 11 Description
The files included in this repository contain a key-pair named Team11Capstone.pem that is necessary to download in order to run the p1.sh script which starts the Virtual Machine. The virtual machine can be used to download the dedicated csv file and parse to the file.

The csv files in this repo are used test files used to ensure that csv files are valid when they are uploaded correctly, and invalid when there exist errors. The file en_es_alphabet.csv is the valid csv file, and all other csv files are intentionally manipulated to test errors in the unit tests.
